/**
 * Four phases of text processing to do. Write a method for each one.
 *
 * public void print()  - write a method that reads the contents of a file, line by line, and creates a String object,
 * making sure all the newlines are preserved. use BufferedReader to do the reading.
 *
 * For the sake of this lab, words are not and do not have punctuation.
 *
 * public WCResult wc(String input)
 * commonly called "wc"; count the number of characters in a file, number of words, number of lines.
 * Returns an object of class WCResult (a POJO) which consists of the three longs you counted.
 *
 * public FrequencyMap wordFrequency(String input)
 * word count. words in a file, produce a map with (String word, Long numOfTimes). FrequencyMap returning a HashMap might be what you're
 * looking for here, or maybe something else.
 *
 * public FrequencyMap letterFrequency(String input)
 * letter frequency, write a program that collects the frequency of each letter within the input.
